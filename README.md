Used Unity5 (2022 Engine) to create a zombie-filled game where you drive a taxi and collect power-ups to stay alive!  Check it out on itch.io (download NOT required): https://tharindudm.itch.io/

> A camera system that can switch between top-down, third-person, and first-person views
> Day-Light Cycle
